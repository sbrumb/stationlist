# Transit station list (2012-2017)

This material extends the [National Transit-Oriented Development (TOD) Database](https://www.cnt.org/tools/tod-database), developed by the Center for Neighborhood Technology, to include transit stations that opened in the United States from 2012 to 2017. For station names and opening dates, I used lists compiled on Wikipedia and checked the information using transit agency websites or newspaper articles. For station locations, I used data from [Transit Explorer](https://www.thetransportpolitic.com/transitexplorer), an interactive map of transit stations and lines produced by Yonah Freemark and Steven Vance.

If you find errors or wish to add information, I welcome issues or pull requests.
