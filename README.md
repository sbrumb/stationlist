# Transit station list

This material, compiled in the course of my dissertation research, extends the [National Transit-Oriented Development (TOD) Database](https://www.cnt.org/tools/tod-database) to include transit stations that opened from 2012 to 2017 in the United States. For station names and opening dates, I used station lists compiled on Wikipedia and checked the information using transit agency websites or newspaper articles. For station locations, I used data from [Transit Explorer](https://www.thetransportpolitic.com/transitexplorer), an interactive map of transit stations and lines produced by Yonah Freemark and Steven Vance.

If you find errors or wish to add information, I welcome issues or pull requests.
